# Fizz Buzz

The quintessential programmer interview question. If the number is divisible by 3, print 'fizz'. If it is divizible by 5, print 'buzz'. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print 'fizzbuzz'. Lastly, if not divisible by three or 5 print nothing.

## Building

### Building - Windows

It's pretty simple. First open a powershell terminal. Then navigate to the root of the project directory. Lastly, run the *build.ps1* script.

``` powershell
./build.ps1
```

### Building - Linux

It is almost identical to building for windows, with two exceptions. Use a linux terminal (duh!), and run the *build.sh* script

``` bash
./build.sh
```
